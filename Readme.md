# RelativeSerreCurves

This is code for the preprint [Serre Curves Relative to Obstructions Modulo 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06645) by Jacob Mayle and Rakvi.

The main function is `IsRelSerreCurve`, which given an elliptic curve E/Q, outputs <true, G> if E is a G-Serre curve for a proper subgroup G of GL(2,Z/2Z), and outputs false otherwise. The functions `ImgCondCs`, `ImgCondB`, `ImgCondCn` compute the image conductor, and `CyclicityCorrectionFactorB` and `CyclicityCorrectionFactorCn` compute the cyclicity correction factor for the corresponding relative Serre curves. There are also several functions that are referenced in the paper.
